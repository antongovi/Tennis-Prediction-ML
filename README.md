**# Tennis Match Prediction Model**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of tennis matches based on historical data. 
The model is trained on tennis match data from 2010 to 2023 and evaluated on matches from 2024.


**## Testing Process and Accuracy of the model:**

The model's performance was assessed through multiple testing phases:

**1. Test on 2023 Data:** The model was tested on tennis matches from the year 2023, resulting in an accuracy of 93.9%.
**2. Test on 2024 Data:** Following this, the model was evaluated on matches from 2024, achieving an accuracy of 93.91%.
**3. Prediction for New Matches:** Currently, the model is being utilized to predict the outcomes of matches that occurred in the past few days. The accuracy for these predictions is 80% so far.
